quarks update

quarks:

When you get infinite meta-antimatter, you can prestige (go quantum) to get quarks. The formula for quarks from meta-antimatter is the same as that for IP from regular antimatter.

quarks on their own aren't that helpful, but they each produce gluons, initially at the rate of 0.05 gluons per second.

gluons boost:
dilated time and meta dimensions by (gluons + 1)
TD by 2^gluons
ID by 2^(gluons^2)
ND by 2^(gluons^3)

There is a cap to gluons, at log2(best meta-antimatter).

The "Go quantum" button is probably just to the right of the "Go eternal" button.

Going quantum resets everything eternity does, and also TT, TD, dilation, MD, current meta-antimatter (not best though), and gluons.

Going quantum is never forced (that is, it starts broken).

There are three quark upgrades, each cost 10 quarks, cost increase 10x:
get 0.05 more gluons per second per quark (Persistent quark)
cap is softer
get 2x quarks from going exponential.

thoughts on formula for softer cap (more for me than for anyone else):
Maybe just take
c = 64 * (#times bought)
real beyond cap = c * ln(ln(gain beyond cap / c + 1) + 1).
I mean who even notices log2 vs ln anyway in this type of situation?

So if gain beyond cap is 1e9 and c is 320 then real beyond cap is 886.
For 2e9 it's 899.

What happens is the cap starts out seeming softer, but quickly becomes harder again
as you can almost immediately get to the point where it caps.

Basically gluons become a fixed multiplier after 10-20 hours of play with the new update, which I think is OK.

end thoughts

you can't spend all your quarks on these upgrades; you have to keep at least one quark at all times after going exponential.

Neutron star:

You can sacrifice all your current gluons, DT, or meta-antimatter to the neutron star.

total gluon sac
log2(total DT sac.max(1))
log2(total MAM sac.max(1))

pairwise products give the three types of boson

each type of boson boosts one of the three types of galaxy by 1 + bosons / 1000

gluon * dt = w^+ bosons which boost normal galaxies
gluon * mam = w^- bosons which boost dilated galaxies
dt * mam = z^0 bosons which boost replicanti galaxies

bosons = floor(product^(1 / 8))

get ability to bulk buy RG (get 1e1e5 replicanti, "It will never be enough")
all meta-dimensions are 10% stronger and you start with 100 MA on reset (get MD8, "And still no ninth dimension...")
all galaxies are 0.1% stronger (get at least 700 of all three types of galaxy, "Universal harmony")
// EP upgrade 2 (the one based on eternities) gets a stronger formula (get a trillion eternities, "The cap is a million, not a trillion")
Meta-dimension boosts are each 1.01x stronger (get 10 meta-dimension boosts, "Meta-boosting to the max")
// 118x multiplier on meta-dimensions and dilated time production (get 51930 quarks, "The whole table")
// other (4):
"I'm so meta" (unlock meta dimensions)
"What did you just say?" (get between 1ieatass and 1ieatast antimatter, but shown in player's notation)
// "Quantum leap" (go quantum)
"In the grim darkness of the far endgame" (get 1e40000 EP)

there are two rows (with undetermined order):

top:
I'm so meta
And still no ninth dimension...
In the grim darkness of the far endgame
Meta-boosting to the max
The cap is a million, not a trillion
It will never be enough
I am speed
Universal harmony

bottom:
// Quantum leap (Sub-atomic)

You're halfway there
// Planck time
What did you just say?
// May the forces be with you 
I never meta-dimension I didn't like
// The whole table
