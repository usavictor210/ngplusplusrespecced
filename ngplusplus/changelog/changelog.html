      <br>
      <b>December 28th, 2022 - January 1st, 2023 (build 1 + 1b)</b>
      <p>Expected stats at end of 1st Quantum: 1e150,000 EP, 1.8e308 meta-antimatter, 1e100 DT.</p>
      <h3>Content</h3>
      <li>Replaced almost all the old NG+2R achievements.</li>
      <li>Eternal Studies are being changed to serve as minor quality of life improvements and buffs.</li>
      <li>Removed Investment completely; Elementary Research Upgrades have completely replaced it.</li>
      <li>Quarks generate gluons that are used for Quantum Research Upgrades.</li>
      <h3>Balance</h3>
      <h4>Note that several of these changes are inspired by or taken from the Reality update and adapted to fit the needs of the modification.<br>Quantum in this mod is going to last until 1e9e15 antimatter.</h4>
      <li>Early game progression changes (NG+2 Respecced is much different than the original NG++)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Temporary boost</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Antimatter Dimension multipliers are now raised to ^1.1 after all other multipliers (exponent decreases based on how close you are to 1e4000 EP)
          </li>
          <li>
            You get 16x more IP.
          </li>
        </ul>
          <li>This is outside of the temporary boost, but there are several Reality update changes and my own changes that make Infinity and Eternity much easier to go through.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Numerous cost changes to Infinity Upgrades were made.</li>
              <li>Autobuyers are much cheaper.</li>
              <li>Eternity Upgrade 1 now always has at least 2x multiplier.</li>
              <li>Achievement multipliers have improved (this has already been implemented), and a couple more new rewards.</li>
              <li>"Eternities are the new infinity" now always gives at least 5x Eternities and a time boost (based on NG^^'s reward).</li>
              <li>"We COULD afford 9" raises Replicanti multiplier to ^1.09 after time study effects.</li>
              <li>"Faster than a potato^286078" now slightly decreases the replicanti interval based on tickspeed decrease.</li>
              <li>"Unique snowflakes" now includes Antimatter Galaxies (galaxies/4) in the formulas of Time Study 102 and 103, and makes Replicanti Galaxies 0.05% more powerful.</li>
              <li>"Now you're thinking with dilation!" raises all Dimension multipliers to ^1.01 and gives double TT and DT production while Dilated.</li>
              <li>A few eternity milestones have been added to alleviate the grind.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>
            As a general change, Eternity Challenges are going to be made easier to complete; you just have to reach the challenge completion tier's respective goal first. (post-Quantum)
          </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Resets are now based on the best prestige currency instead of current.</li>
      <li>Limited EP multiplier: 1e100,000 EP is now the hard limit for buying EP multipliers.</li>
      <li>Limited Infinity Dimensions: You can now only buy 2,500,000 of each Infinity Dimension, to prevent reality from breaking. However, you may be able to extend the limit...</li>
      <li>Limited Time Dimensions: Time Dimensions, except for the 8th Time Dimension, will no longer have multiplier increases after 500,000 purchases.</li>
      <li>Tickspeed upgrades will also scale much faster after 1,000,000 tickspeed upgrades.</li>
      <li>Heavily nerfed Meta Dimensions (^8 -> ^5) - the Dilation upgrade has been changed along with this (^5 -> ^6).</li>
      <li>Meta-Antimatter Galaxies will be kept, but their cost scales after buying a few galaxies and their effect increase will slowly decrease.</li>
      <li>The rebuyable 2x IP multiplier upgrade can no longer be bought after 1e100,000,000 IP.</li>
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <li>Added the Quantum reset button on top of the antimatter display. It will not disappear after going Quantum.</li>
      <li>Added per-10 multiplier to the Dimensions tab.</li>
      <li>Fixed the time display (seconds plural no longer shows at 1 second)</li>
      <li>Replaced long durations with the âˆž symbol and the past 10 prestiges appropriately show if you haven't performed a prestige.</li>
      <li>Made it easier to see Eternity milestones (more milestones are placed per row) and separated the milestones before Dilation and after Dilation.</li>
      <li>Basic tab of Quantum should be fixed.</li>
      <li>You can see how much of a resource you have towards the requirement for Eternity Challenges.</li>
      <li>Reality update change: The game now explicitly tells you when certain prices jump.</li>
      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <li>Tried to improve the vanilla codebase. (A port to Vue/Reality update will be tougher)</li>
      <li>Several vanilla achievements have had their achievements changed to be less edgy. NG+2R achievements may have their images fixed for quality assurance.</li>
      <li>Removed and replaced many news tickers. Some were originally taken from the mobile version of Antimatter Dimensions (sorry).</li>
      <li>A new row of secret achievements!</li>
      <li>Options menu has been organized and checked for mistakes.</li>
      <li></li>
