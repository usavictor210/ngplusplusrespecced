    <h2>ALPHA 0.1.2 - March 8th, 2020</h2>
    <list>
      <li>
        "But I wanted another prestige layer..." has been given a reward
        (another reward taken from Eternity Respecced): Time Dimensions gain a
        multiplier based on EP. ((((exponent of EP-308)+1)^(5+(log20(exponent of
        EP, 20)))))+1) (log20 might seem weird but it's just the 20th root.)
      </li>
      <li>Fixed more CSS things that were 0px and repeated stuff.</li>
      <li>
        Fixed unstable dilation variables not being saved in
        challenges/dilation, causing it to break because of it being undefined.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed the font size of the popup.</li>
      <li>Dilation upgrade 3, 4 and 7 shows its current multiplier.</li>
      <li>
        Fixed the bug where "Eternities are the new infinity" had less than 1x
        multiplier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investing quarks in features work now, but THE FORMULAS FOR INVESTMENTS
        ARE NOT FINAL.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed the display bug in the Quantum tab.</li>
      <li>
        Fixed the NaN% bug on the progress bar when it was attempting to display
        "Percentage to "In the grim darkness of the far endgame"", as it was
        attempting to access an achievement id that didn't exist on this
        version, but did in Aarex's site.
      </li>
      <li>This is probably going to be a short update now.</li>
    </list>
    <h2>ALPHA 0.1.1 - March 7th, 2020</h2>
    <list>
      <li>
        Took Aarex's progress bar and information scale code and tweaked it, and
        put it in new functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed challenge 1's reward text to mention that you get 100 antimatter
        (because the game actually relies on that to consider the antimatter
        reward, and not "To infinity!", although it doesn't matter since that
        you get "Blink of an eye"'s reward).
      </li>
      <li>Changed EC reward text and put it in a new function.</li>
      <li>
        Giving access to more news tickers because there's one news ticker in
        particular that requires all other tickers, and changed some news
        tickers because I wanted to.
      </li>
      <li>Quark gain text displayed in meta-dimensions is now formatted.</li>
      <li>
        "Eternities are the new infinity" and "Long lasting relationship" will
        now display their respective multipliers.
      </li>
      <li>
        "In the grim darkness of the far endgame" now properly removes the 10x
        replicanti interval before infinity replicanti from TS133.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buffed achievement multiplier to 1.125x per achievement. Now that's an
        achievement.
      </li>
      <li>Made the achievement tooltips actually update ingame.</li>
      <li>
        Buffed "Eternities are the new infinity"
        (Math.min(Math.sqrt(player.thisEternity/20), 30)) -&gt;
        (Math.min(Math.sqrt(player.thisEternity/12.5), 30))
      </li>
      <li>
        "We could afford 9" has been given a reward (inspired by Eternity
        Respecced): Replicanti multiplier is boosted to the power of 1.09 (after
        time studies).
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally fixed the IC not persisting on reload bug (made it check for
        challenge 1 being completed). Silly me.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed not being able to unstabilize dilation because of excess equal
        signs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unstable dilation actually increases TP gain now. WARNING: COULD CAUSE
        INFLATION. Report bugs in the #bugs channel if you see it.
      </li>
      <li>
        One final checkup: Running it through
        <a
          href="https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/usavictor210/ngplusplusrespecced/"
          >CodeFactor</a
        >
        to catch the stuff I didn't fix.
      </li>
      <li>Dimboosts, galaxies and 8th dimension cost/amounts are prettier.</li>
      <li>
        Change a lot of 0px to 0 in the CSS, and also fixed "all" the bugs in
        the html, except for ONE PHANTOM BUG.
      </li>
      <li>I guess it's time to actually make new content now.</li>
      <h3>Broken stuff</h3>
      <li>
        "In the grim darkness of the far endgame" progress on the progress bar
        displays NaN%.
      </li>
    </list>
    <h2>ALPHA 0.1 - March 6th, 2020</h2>
    <list>
      <li>
        Found out the offline IP break infinity upgrade bug existed and just
        copied and pasted the vanilla code to fix it. (Aarex why have you not
        fixed this yet)
      </li>
      <li>
        Continued to sort out the spaghetti code. It's looking better now.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed plurals for the last 10 infinities and eternities.</li>
      <li>
        Eternities stat calculation uses ceiling (because decimals just look
        weird).
      </li>
      <li>Trying to finally fix the ICs don't save on refresh bug.</li>
      <li>
        There has been a report on unstable shard bugs, so I will fix that later
        if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>The dilation button states that you need 1.8e308 IP to gain TP.</li>
    </list>
    <h2>ALPHA 0 - February 2020 -&gt; March 2020: The Beginning</h2>
    <list>
      <li>Started work on NG+2 Respecced.</li>
      <li>
        A new row of achievements spanning from the original endgame of NG++ to
        early Quantum has been created. They have their own rewards and have
        their own pictures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unstable Dilation has begun being worked on. This will coincide with the
        Time Rift.
      </li>
      <li>2 new dilation upgrades that might make dilation bearable again.</li>
      <li>Added lots of news tickers. Most of them are dumb.</li>
      <li>
        Rephrased many of vanilla game's descriptions for each mechanic,
        challenge and achievement.
      </li>
      <li>Begun organizing the spaghetti code that is game.js.</li>
      <li>
        Quantum is being worked on, but the buttons don't actually work because
        I didn't implement them yet.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can see how many eternities and infinities you get from their
        respective button once you can get 1e100,000 of their respective point.
      </li>
      <li>
        Going to fix "I'm so meta" import later since I need to make sure
        everything is stabilized in Quantum first.
      </li>
      <li>
        Begun NG+ v3: You start with 1,012,680 eternities (this may be changed
        on Quantum to give you the max TS191 and EU2 boost with 1,012,680
        eternities but give you only 100 eternities), 1 trillion banked
        infinities, start with 1,024x IP mult (which resets later), start with
        all normal challenges completed, and also start with "Fake News" and
        "Don't you dare sleep". All NG+ v2 changes persist.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Long lasting relationship" and "Eternities are the new infinity" have
        been given rewards: Infinity Dimensions are more powerful based on EC1's
        reward to the power of 10, and you gain 30x eternitied stat on longer
        eternities (reward taken from
        <a href="https://soul147.github.io/">AD Ultimate</a> and tweaked to
        balance for NG+2R, this is because of another reward to eternities in
        mid-dilation.).
      </li>
      <li>
        "In the grim darkness of the far endgame" has been given a reward to
        remove active/passive/idle RG nerfs.
      </li>
      <li>
        "I'm so meta" has been given a reward to unlock the dilation upgrade
        autobuyer.
      </li>
      <li>"Meta-boosting to the max" has been given a better picture.</li>
      <li>Changed the changelog files and took Aarex's CSS for them.</li>
      <li>
        Made EU2 actually change its formula visually when you get "The cap is a
        million, not a trillion".
      </li>
      <li>
        Max all will instead max all meta dimensions when you unlock them.
        Speaking of meta dimensions, their autobuyers are unlocked at 1e25x of
        each multiplier for each MD ("I never meta-dimension I didn't like").
      </li>
      <li>
        Removed all Kong variables and changed the Shop to the Quantum tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Did stuff to time studies and added some stuff. However, they don't do
        anything yet because I have no idea how to make them work. When I get a
        time study to work though, it will be fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Made the game buy 1 1st time dimension if you haven't bought it when you
        attempt to buy a time theorem with EP.
      </li>
      <li>...and that's only the beginning. There will be more. MORE.</li>
