      <h3>Content</h3>

      <li>Eternal Studies are being changed to serve as minor quality of life improvements and buffs.</li>

      <li>Quarks generate gluons that are used for Quantum Research Upgrades.</li>
      <h3>Balance</h3>
      <h4>Note that several of these changes are inspired by or taken from the Reality update and adapted to fit the needs of the modification.<br>Quantum in this mod is going to last until 1e9e15 antimatter.</h4>
      <li>Added a temporary boost before e4000 EP as NG+2R is now going to have different progression than the original NG++.</li>
      <li>Added several Reality update changes that makes Infinity and Eternity much easier to go through.</li>
      <li>Resets are now based on the best prestige currency instead of current.</li>
      <li>"Faster than a potato^286078" now slightly decreases the replicanti interval based on tickspeed decrease.</li>
      <li>Limited EP multiplier: 1e100,000 EP is now the hard limit for buying EP multipliers.</li>
      <li>Limited Infinity Dimensions: You can now only buy 2,500,000 of each Infinity Dimension, to prevent reality from breaking. However, you may be able to extend the limit...</li>
      <li>Limited Time Dimensions: Time Dimensions, except for the 8th Time Dimension, will no longer have multiplier increases after 500,000 purchases.</li>
      <li>Tickspeed upgrades will also scale much faster after 1,000,000 tickspeed upgrades.</li>
      <li>Heavily nerfed Meta Dimensions (^8 -> ^5) - the Dilation upgrade has been changed along with this (^5 -> ^6).</li>
      <li>Meta-Antimatter Galaxies will be kept, but they will eventually scale.</li>
      <li>The rebuyable 2x IP multiplier upgrade can no longer be bought after 1e100,000,000 IP.</li>
      <li>Reality update change: A few eternity milestones have been added to alleviate the grind.</li>
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <li>Added the Quantum reset button on top of the antimatter display. It will not disappear after going Quantum.</li>
      <li>Added per-10 multiplier to the Dimensions tab.</li>
      <li>Fixed the time display (seconds plural no longer shows at 1 second)</li>
      <li>Replaced long durations with the âˆž symbol and the past 10 prestiges appropriately show if you haven't performed a prestige.</li>
      <li>Made it easier to see Eternity milestones (more milestones are placed per row)</li>
      <li>Basic tab of Quantum should be fixed.</li>
      <li>You can see how much of a resource you have towards the requirement for Eternity Challenges.</li>
      <li>Reality update change: The game now explicitly tells you when certain prices jump.</li>
      <li></li>
      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
      <li>Tried to improve the vanilla codebase. (A port to Vue/Reality update will be tougher)</li>
      <li>Several vanilla achievements have had their achievements changed to be less edgy. NG+2R achievements may have their images fixed for quality assurance.</li>
      <li>Removed and replaced many news tickers. Some were taken from the mobile version of Antimatter Dimensions (sorry).</li>
      <li>A new row of secret achievements!</li>
      <li>Options menu has been organized and checked for mistakes.</li>
      <li></li>
