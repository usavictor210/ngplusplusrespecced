Quantum idea: quarks, gluons, investment

When you quantum, you gain quarks.
Quarks can be invested into different mechanics.

Quantum idea: Exponential Challenges

Exponential Challenges are like regular challenges, but each of them has different goals. Additionally, they can be completed multiple times, like Eternity Challenges.

ExC1: You are locked to 4 dimensions in all categories except Meta.
Goal: 1e160000 AM, 1e32000 IPw, 1e5000 TSh 
Reward: You gain [completions] free 8th dimensions outside of dilation/challenges.
