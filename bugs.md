# BUGS (pesky bugs...)

## Major
- player.ngPlus goes undefined when you start a new quantum (or eternity, or infinity)
- Something in break infinity breaks when you quantum (Found the cause, it's because of the infinitied mult to all dimensions (It's actually getDimensionFinalMultiplier))) // Oof, I think infinitied stat amount broke
- ^ FIXED: It was timeLeaperMult()

## Minor
- TS271 breaks the shift click (buy all studies)
