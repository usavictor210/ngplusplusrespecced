The next update will heavily change tons of game balancing, features and other stuff that
may make transferring your current saves to the new version impossible without immense amounts
of effort.

Because of this, I have decided to warn you about this now:

EXPORT YOUR SAVES.

I am not quite sure how much the saves will break, but testing should reveal that none of that ever happens.
Going on the test site should help with preparing for future content changes.
However, I will change many variables and other things in the new update.

The new update is expected to come out very very soon under ALPHA 0.4.
Alpha 0.4 will have content from early-mid Quantum balanced.
For what exactly is to come, check usavictorideas.txt.

Once all content in Quantum is done, there may be a new prestige layer coming up, but
don't be too sure about it. I don't think you need to know what it is yet.
